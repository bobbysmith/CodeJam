## Syntrax
----

Syntrax is an app built with Ruby on Rails that allows developers to share music through SoundCloud.  Very often we get lost in our own world in ront of our keyboards with headphones on.  This app is a platform for you to share with other developers what you are listening to, what awesome tracks are inspiring you to write great code.  GitHib was used for authentication, as a way to make more exclusive to developers.
